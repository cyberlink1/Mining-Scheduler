Directory to store the miner software

The download-miners.sh is a script I use to download the miners and install them here. 

has to be run as "sudo ./download-miners.sh" as the first thing it does it makes sure unzip is installed.

It seems there is no avaliable copy of sgminer for Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS)
The build-sgminer.sh will download a copy of the sgminer source as well as the ADL SDK and build it from scratch.
